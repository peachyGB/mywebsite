        <p>Hi! My name is Georgia. Some people call me Peachy. You can choose to use the name you prefer. </p>
        <!-- Learn how to insert a counter to see vote between Georgia and Peachy-->

        <p>As many do, I have some aspirations and I have listed them here in a very particular order.</p>
            <ol>
                <li> Making people laugh</li>
                <li> Being a good dog mom</li>
                <li> Curing my small brain syndrome (SBS) by learning new things</li>
                <li> Profit</li>
            </ol>

        <p>As mentioned, I am a dog mom. Here you can see Josie's best pinto bean impression</p>

            <img src="/media/pinto bean.jpg" alt="Josie Photo">
            <img src="/media/pinto bean.jpg" alt="Real Pinto">
        </div>
        <!-- add photo of a pinto bean that switches to photo of Josie with mouse hover. images broken, add them through ubuntu?
        ~/Development/code/prework/mywebsite -->

        <p> Speaking of food, I love the stuff. So original. I know. Can you guess what my favorite food is? (hint: its not peaches)</p>
