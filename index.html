        <p>As many do, I have some aspirations and I have listed them here in a very particular order.</p>
            <ol>
                <li> Making people laugh</li>
                <li> Being a good dog mom</li>
                <li> Curing my small brain syndrome (SBS) by learning new things</li>
                <li> Profit</li>
            </ol>

        <p>As mentioned, I am a dog mom. Click here to see a picture my Josie's best pinto bean impression</p>
        <!-- add photo of Josie -->

        <p> Speaking of food, I love the stuff. So original. I know. Can you guess what my favorite food is? (hint: its not peaches)</p>
        <!-- add a really sexy video of carbonara. Have it hidden until you mouse hover or click. Some fancy italian music should be playing as well-->
